# Bridgenet Whitepaper


# 1. Introduction

Bridgenet is a decentralized trustless network that acts as a relay between two communicating parties via HTTP/HTTPS protocols. Specifically, when a user attempts to send a request to some website, the information can be intercepted and analyzed by various third parties (nefarious, Orwellian, etc.). Projects like <cite>[Tor][1]</cite> and <cite>[I2P][2]</cite> attempt to obfuscate the path between a user and his/her destination. In standard TCP/IP communication, both parties have information (specifically the IP address) of the other party. While Tor relay nodes remove this information, the problem is the lack of nodes due partially to the lack of incentive of being a relay.

The figure above shows that there are currently 6,000 Tor relays and they are maintained in a <cite>[centralized list][3]</cite>
