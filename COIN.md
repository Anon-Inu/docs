# Coin FAQ

## What are the limitations of a blockchain-based coin?

## Why do transactions need to be validated and how does it relate to consensus?

## Can the `Blockchain Trilemma` be solved?

```
1. Scalability: the chain can process more transactions than a single regular node (think: a consumer laptop) can verify.
2. Decentralization: the chain can run without any trust dependencies on a small group of large centralized actors. This is typically interpreted to mean that there should not be any trust (or even honest-majority assumption) of a set of nodes that you cannot join with just a consumer laptop.
3. Security: the chain can resist a large percentage of participating nodes trying to attack it (ideally 50%; anything above 25% is fine, 5% is definitely not fine).
